# SETTING A GOAL  
  
**The first step in any journey is setting a destination.**  
In order to sell yourself as as a candidate, you have to get familiar with the industry and more importantly, the job. We will discuss the tools needed to so and how to set SMART goals.

### Assignment  
Find a job description for a job you could realistically apply to after graduation. The job must be relevant to your course of study (IT Support/Networking), appropriate for your level of experience and in a field that is interesting to you. This position can be anywhere in the world, but make sure the description is detailed enough to highlight your relevant skills.  
  
Once you've found the job you want, save it to PDF and upload it to your Google Drive folder.
