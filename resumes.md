# RESUMES  
  
**I have no experience. I have too much experience. Where do I start?**  
Writing a resume can be a confusing process. There are many differing opinions as to how to format the document, how to explain gaps and even how to market experience from a different (non-technical) field. We will cover Do's and Don'ts, and also have an in-depth discussion about common issues.  
  
### Assignment  
Upload the first draft of your resume to your Google Drive folder.
  
**Please note, we will work on several drafts of your resume. Once you've completed the final draft, you will all upload your resumes to Creddle.io and post the link to a Google Doc in your folder.**
